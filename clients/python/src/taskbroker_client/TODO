Fix ups
- metrics - How will that even work?
  Maybe attach a metrics backend to the app, and import the app all over the place?
- Kafka producers? - Use arroyo? How to get at the singletons's? Perhaps have a protocol for getting a producer based on topic?


Application improvements
- need a way to inject a router object.
- need a way to provide a producer factory.
